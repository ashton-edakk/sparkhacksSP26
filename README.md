The Problem: Platforms like YouTube incentivize clickbait, thumbnails, and SEO. 
Skills that have nothing to do with teaching.
This creates a "Hidden Gem" crisis:
Brilliant professors with 50 views are buried.
Students find popular videos, not helpful ones.
Educational merit is lost to viral engagement.

Our solution is a "Transcript-First Search"
We built a discovery engine that ignores metadata. 
We don't care about the thumbnail. 
We listen to the actual words spoken in the lecture to find the best explanation.
